			<h1 class="cool-font title">2 Big Tips for Coding Bootcamp and 1 Small One</h1>
			<h3 class="text-font sub-title">I recently completed a three-month Python bootcamp. Here are some of the fun and helpful things I figured out along the way.</h3>
			<h4 class="segment">The 10 minute rule</h4>
			<p>First, a word about coding projects. In the beginning, they are cute little things, with a couple lines of code and a rather straightforward purpose. They then get progressively bigger, with more files and often incorporating other’s work.</p>
			<p>Anyway, when we started doing bigger projects, I discovered what I call the 10 minute rule. If you get stuck, don’t immediately ask for help -- first try your hardest to work it out all by yourself for 10 minutes. I realized that as a rookie, when the exercises are small and simple, the fastest way to learn is to just break your head on it till the solution materializes.</p>
			<p>But when the projects begin to get bigger and more complex, it’s simply not worth it to get bogged down by roadblocks. Take 10 minutes so that you don’t learn to be lazy and needy, but if during those 10 minutes you tried a couple things and googled a bunch and thought of ways to approach it from a few different angles, and you’re still not getting anywhere, it’s worth it to cut your losses and get some direction.</p>
			<p>The solution will usually just bring even more complex and interesting problems and the opportunity to learn and develop really doesn’t end as you spiral ever deeper into real code.</p>
			<h4 class="segment">Zooming in and zooming out</h4>
			<p>An interesting phenomenon emerged about a month into the bootcamp. The students who were starting to lag behind did so for surprisingly diverse reasons. There was the usual gradual realization of uninterest and slowing beginner's passion. There were also those who didn’t really have the right smarts or favored the other half of their brain.</p>
			<p>But the most interesting was the case of not knowing when to zoom in and when to zoom out. Honestly, this is something we all struggled with, but it would sometimes swallow its victims whole since it was so hard to pin down. Let me explain.</p>
			<p>Fact: Code is made of blocks of code inside blocks of code inside blocks of code. It’s blocks of code all the way down.</p>
			<p>Each block will affect all the others as the logic climbs up and up till it manifests in virtual (and sometimes physical) reality. As the creators of these blocks, careful attention must be given to both the minutiae of the smallest and most intricate of blocks, but also to the whole collection and how they interact with each other on a grand scale. The problem is, this is nearly impossible to do simultaneously until it becomes second-nature.</p>
			<p>My advice: Keep zooming in and zooming out. While you’re working on a tiny block, jump back and look at the broad view so you’re aware of how the block fits into the big picture. And when you’re reviewing the broad view, jump in and look at the small pieces so you’re reminded of what’s contributing to the whole. Oscillate until you’re literally seasick. Soon the vibrations will blend into one beautiful note on the scale of computational elegance.</p>
			<h4 class="segment">The fork in the road</h4>
			<p>This one’s a bit obscure, but it was burned into me by the atomic blast that bootcamp turned out to be, so you’ll have to deal with it.</p>
			<p>In the bootcamp we were given both front-end and back-end skills. What have I learned? That I like to use my brain. And instead of using it to figure out how to traverse the frontend mess which is HTML and CSS to try to get my project to just look like it should, I could use it to employ a beautiful backend language like Python to do things I never thought possible.</p>
			<h4 class="segment">In conclusion</h4>
			<p>Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I had approached all the learning I have ever done as I did in bootcamp. I think each year of school could have been reduced to two months.</p>
			<p>If you want to get into coding in the right environment and acquire a depth of understanding at lightning speed, take my word for it. Go to bootcamp.</p>
			<p>Just keep the 10 minute rule in mind, don’t forget to zoom in and zoom out, embrace the backend if the frontend doesn’t tickle your brain, and you’ll be fine.</p>
